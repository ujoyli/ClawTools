# Computer Science Papers Every Developer Should Read

The foundations of modern software engineering were built on some high-impact research papers. From the algorithms powering most apps today to the databases storing data, many technologies we use daily emerged from academic publications. While these papers might initially seem complex, they offer important insights that can transform your approach to software development.

In this article, we will discuss why it is crucial to read computer science papers, how to do so, and some of my recommendations for the best research papers in the field, the following categories:

- **🧩 System Design and Programming Fundamentals**
- **🌐 Distributed Systems**
- **🗄️ Data Storage and Processing**
- **📏 System Design and Metrics**
- **☁️ Modern Infrastructure**
- 🖥️ **Computer Architecture and Systems Performance**
- 🔍 **Search and Information Retrieval**

So, let’s dive in.

## Why should you read computer science papers?

Learning new things is essential for developers, as it helps us build and develop new skills for the job. Yet, I have found that people do not read many research papers on computer science.

You might wonder: *Why should I read research papers?* In those papers, you will **understand different computer science and software engineering concepts** (depth and breadth). Most of the features you use today in your programming languages came from some of those papers, and with new papers, you can predict what will come in the future.

Reading research papers also **cultivates critical thinking**. It allows you to see how others have tackled similar problems, offering solutions and ideas that can save you from reinventing the wheel. For instance, foundational work on large language models (LLMs), such as “[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)” by Vaswani et al. (2017), has shaped technologies like ChatGPT.

## What are recommended research papers to read?

Here is the list of the most crucial computer science papers by each category:

### 🧩 System Design and Programming Fundamentals

#### 1. 📄 [On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules (1972), D.L. Parnas](https://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/edu/2ip30/references/criteria_for_modularization.pdf)

In this paper, Parnas discussed modularization as a mechanism for improving a system's flexibility and comprehensibility while reducing its development time. He also discussed the criteria for decomposing systems into modules. The principles in this paper directly influence modern software architecture, microservices design, and API development.
